        Here is more info about Prafful: 
         
        Prafful Bisht is a Student who belongs from dehradun Uttrakhand India. He has completed his schooling or primary and secondary education form DAV Public school Paonta Sahib Himachal pradesh.currently he lives in Paonta sahib ,Himachal Pradesh.Now He is pursuing his Graduation i.e B.tech from SRM university in Computer science and engineering with specialization in Artifical intelligence and machine learning.My academic journey, underscored by a stellar CGPA of 9.5, reflects my commitment to mastering innovative technologies.
        he loves programming and buikding new websites.Prafful has always been fascinated by engineering. His curiosity and affinity for software engineering have guided him to explore various technological domains.Prafful's professional experience spans multiple aspects of software development. He has excelled in Android development using Java on Android Studio, mastered full-stack web development, and delved deeply into machine learning and computer vision. Notable projects include advanced applications in computer vision, focusing on hand detection, face recognition, and other complex visual recognition tasks.
        In computer vision he has made project The Hand Gesture Mouse Control -  leverages OpenCV to enable users to control their computer's mouse cursor using hand gestures detected through a webcam. This innovative application utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize and track hand movements, translating them into mouse cursor movements in real-time. By detecting specific gestures, such as finger pointing or hand waving, the system can perform various mouse functions like moving the cursor, clicking, and zooming.
        He is more focused towards Artifical Intelligence and machine learning currently he is learning more about Deep learning.

        Outside the tech world, Prafful has a variety of interests:

        Reading Books: His favorite books are Silent Patient and Atomic Habits.
        Watching Football: He is a fan of the German national team and the club Real Madrid.
